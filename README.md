# DragonCave Egg Time Finder

Finds the time at which eggs on [DragonCave](https://dragcave.net/) change their hour.
It does this by refreshing every 2 seconds for (at most) an hour. There is not a better way (that I know of).

## Usage Information

1. Install the extension somehow.
2. Click `Enable refreshing`.
3. Wait a while.
4. Eventually `Changed between` will show the times between which the egg could have changed time. Use this for whatever.
5. Click `Disable refreshing`.
